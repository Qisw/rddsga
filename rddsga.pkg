d 'RDDSGA': Subgroup analysis for regression discontinuity designs using inverse propensity score weighting
d
d  rddsga allows to conduct a binary subgroup analysis in RDD settings
d  based on propensity score weighting (PSW). Observations in each subgroup 
d  are weighted by the inverse of their conditional probabilities to belong 
d  to that subgroup, given a set of covariates. Performing RDD analysis 
d  separately within each weighted subgroup eliminates potential confounding 
d  differences due to other observable factors that may vary systematically 
d  across (uneweighted) subgroups.
